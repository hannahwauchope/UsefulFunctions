### UsefulFunctions
This is a repository for useful functions that I often use. At the moment it contains:

### Climate Data Related Functions
CRUClimateData - This is a function to get rasters of recently historical climate data from CRU TS4

ExtractBeyerClimateData - This extracts palaeoclimate data as constructed from the Beyer et al paper - "High-resolution terrestrial climate, bioclimate and vegetation for the last 120,000 years" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0552-1

ClimateVelocity - This function calculates the velocity of climate change from climate rasters

### Spatial Functions 
SquareRasterCells - This is a really quick funciton that I got from adamlilith/enmSdm (https://rdrr.io/github/adamlilith/enmSdm/src/R/squareRastCells.r) - ALL CREDIT TO HIM!! It converts raster cells into squares, which is required for SDMS using MaxEnt

GetLoadGBIF - This contains functions to download and (mildly) clean occurrence data from GBIF

VisualiseYourSpatialData - This is a function to create maps or animations of spatial map data, either points, polygons or rasters (or any combo of the three)
